Some nav elements lead nowhere, so add pages/more nav elements and connect them if you want.
Same goes with footer elements, you might want to add an email address and make it so it automatically loads up their email.

Copy and paste '.faq-box' elements if you want to add more, or just remove them if you dont want them.
But this can't be done with '.service-item' elements, because of they are positioned on the page.

It's probably best to add the phone number in a better location, maybe at the top, or below 'get a quote' section.
